  entry: I feel as if this mansion is becoming my prison. Whatever is prowling around
    is giving me great discomfort - in my own home. It angers me! This is my house,
    god damnit! But I'm not stupid. I've started locking the bedroom door with a
    lever in the room opposite, and having Gertrude pull it to let me out in the
    morning.
