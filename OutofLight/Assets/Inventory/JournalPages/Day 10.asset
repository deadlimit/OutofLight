  entry: "I\u2019ve just put up some of the old bear traps and started barricading
    some doors in hope for safety. Maybe I should just leave the property, try walking
    the long road to town. Maybe someone will see me on the road. I'll leave by the
    Cellar Door, but I leave behind my spare key in my desk."
