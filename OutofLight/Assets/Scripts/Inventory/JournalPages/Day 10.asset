  entry: "I\u2019ve just put up some of the old bear traps and started barricading
    some doors in hope for safety. Maybe I should just leave the property, try walking
    the long road to town. Maybe someone will see me on the road. I've started locking
    the bedroom door with a lever in the room opposite, and having Gertrude pull
    it to let me out in the morning."
